This is a tree-based priority queue implementation.

1. The SimpleTree.cpp and SimpleTree.hpp are tree-based bounded priority queue implementation

2. RunnerThread.cpp and RunnerThread.hpp are test driver for both sequential and concurrent operation on SimpleTree

3. Makefile can compile and generate a a.out executable file

4. main.cpp included sequential correctness check and sequential, concurrency runtime performance
